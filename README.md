### Description

Updated: this idea was expanded from Brian Kurtyka's Self updaing transparent / translucent form using the alphablend (THX a mil brian, you taught me alphablending just from that one examble...)

in the screenshot you'll see a shadow cast by the form. Draws directly to the screen, uses the RedrawWindow API, and all in a simple to add OCX for those who dont wanna mess with the code.. just add it and run it, and theres your effect.. due to the alphablending dll, this will *now* run in the IDE, just copy the dll's to your system dir.. i use lots of DoEvents to make sure everyhting is done right..*shrug*
